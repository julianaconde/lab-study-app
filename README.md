## 📋Prerequisites

- Python 3.9+ installed
- VS Code or Codespaces with GitHub Copilot extension
- GitHub account with GitHub Copilot subscription (which is available for free for individuals)

## 🔍 Lab Overview

The StudyPlan AI application consists of two main components:

- A Flask-based web interface for user interaction.
- An AI integration layer that uses GitHub Models to create the study plans based on user input and preferences.

You'll learn how to configure the application, create custom study plans, and modify the AI prompts to enhance the generated content.
